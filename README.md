# AccuTermClient-Personal-Configs
Configuration files for MultiValue development using AccuTermClient in Sublime Text.

These are the various configuration files that I use the the Sublime Text user package folder (%appdata%\Sublime Text 3\Packages\User). The define key bindings, custom commands, and custom snippets. Some of these are useful for general development in MV with Sublime, others are specific to our organization's code base.
